					<h1>Ladies, learn English with confidence!</h1>
					<p>Hi, my name is Aparna Deshpande.</p>
					<p>I’m an English teacher and the name of my institute is WordTree Academy. I am an IELTS certification trainer from the British Council. I’ve been in this field for the last 12 years and have successfully trained more than 2000 students.</p>
					<p>The unique feature of this course is that it's only for ladies. Why?The reason is simple. In my experience, ladies open up better in the company of other ladies. Hence, we can discuss many topics which are close to us, from fashion to cookery to our family. In this way, learning becomes more interesting.</p>
					<p>I am sure many of you will remember  embarrassing situations in your life, when you wanted to say something, but didn't know the right words. Many times you lose confidence and avoid speaking due to fear of making mistakes or being laughed at.</p>
					<p>Believe me, this obstacle is only in your mind. I have seen so many ladies who, with some practice, learned to speak fluent English, even though they couldn’t before. If you are confident, you can cross every hurdle and WordTree is the right place to gain that confidence.</p>
					<b><h3>Classes offered</h3></b>
					<b><h5>Basic English with Grammar</h5></b>
					<p>We cover the basics of English speaking along with grammar. You will learn how to read, write and speak in grammatically correct English. We will build your confidence through conversations about various topics.</p>
					<b><h5>Advanced Conversation 1</h5></b>
					<p>We improve your skills by introducing role playing and exploring how you will speak English in different life situations. You will get a chance to think and express your views freely in English</p>
					<b><h5>Advanced Conversation 2</h5></b>
					<p>We will learn how to use English in formal and professional settings. From speaking to your child’s teacher at a PTA meeting, to giving a presentation in front of your CEO, or an interview at a multinational company or a conversation during a dinner at a five star hotel, we take such situations and build our English speaking skill around it.</p>
